Solarized for Espresso v2
=========================

Adapting the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color palette for Espresso v2. I like things colorful, so if you don't, this probably isn't for you; please feel free to fork and make it your own. This is a serious work in progress and may or may not work in v1 - untested at the moment.
